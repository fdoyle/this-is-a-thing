So, if you're running android, Google knows where you're going and what you're doing. With Google Opinion Rewards, they give you money in exchange for telling them _why_.

It's not much, maybe 10-50 cents a survey, but it adds up. It's good for apps, video, even audiobooks. 

Sure, it's weird and creepy, but only if you think about it too hard.
