description: This is Gatsby, a react-based framework for creating static sites
---So, it makes sense to start this blog off by talking about the technology powering it. Everybody knows about react already, even outside the web world, but Gatsby was new to me, and I think it's really cool. Basically, you build a mostly standard react-based site, run it through gatsby, and it spits out a static website for you. I haven't figured out everything it can do yet, and I'm no great shakes at react yet anyway, but I've been super happy with it. It's really fast, and makes a lot of things really easy.
