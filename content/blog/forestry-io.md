So, forestry is pretty cool. It's a web-based CMS that plugs into your git repo. Hook it up to your github, tell it what repo your blog is in, then tell it what kind of blog it is (gatsby, in my case), couple other things, and it handles your posts, post metadata, and images. 

I'm not sure if I'll stick with it forever, or if I'll switch to one of the countless other services that do something similar, but for the moment I'm happy with it.
