Well, the guy behind it, Martin Molin, is working to make a successor that will be robust enough to go on tour.</p>\n<p>Since starting on the project a little over 3 years ago, he’s made over 100 videos documenting the progress he’s made. And while the machine itself is awesome, it’s the documentation itself I want to highlight here.</p>\n<p>Social media has a tendency to show only the highlights of life. Few open up about their failures, their setbacks, their fears, and about their attempts to cope with all of those things. So, when someone comes along and reveals that side of themselves, even a little, it stands out to me, and I think it’s worth pointing out and appreciating.</p>\n<p>The series is honest. It shows the rough edges of a project like this. Prototypes representing weeks of work that just don’t perform, working on trivial tasks to avoid big decisions, having to settle for less-than-elegant solutions to strange problems, stuff that tons of people can relate to, but that can seem overwhelming when you feel like you’re facing it alone.</p>\n<p>Yet, even after years of effort, with all the inevitable difficulties that go with that, Martin endures, and that’s a true inspiration.</p>\n<p>Here’s a link to his youtube channel, so check it out: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Marble Machine X","date":"January 30, 2020","description":"Marble Machine, but better.
